# InstagramWrapped

Ever wished Instagram had its own version of Spotify Wrapped? So did I! **InstagramWrapped** is a personal project that brings this idea to life, offering users a fun and engaging way to reflect on their Instagram DMs usage and engagement over the year.

## 🎯 Why I Built This

I’ve always been a fan of **Spotify Wrapped** and looked forward to its release every year. When I realized Instagram was my most-used social media app, I couldn’t help but wonder why it didn’t have its own version of Wrapped. So, I decided to take matters into my own hands and build it myself.

I shared the concept and eventually the project with my friends, ultimately garnering over **125 users** within the the first day of its release.

## 🛠️ Tools I Used

To create **InstagramWrapped**, I used a combination of modern web technologies and tools:

- **React**: For building the interactive user interface.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling and responsive design.
- **Node.js**: For backend services.
- **Express.js**: For server-side logic and APIs.

## 🚀 What’s Next

I’m actively working on new features to enhance the experience:
- **Insights on Story Interactions**: View analytics on how followers engage with your stories.
- **Feed Preferences**: Gain insights into which types of posts perform best on your feed.
